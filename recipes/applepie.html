    <h4>Recipe instructions (taken from the Necronomicon)</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First, preheat your oven to 375°F, because even zombie apple pies need a good baking.</li>
        <li>Next, start by peeling and coring your rotten apples. Be sure to leave as much mold on as possible, because that's where all the flavor is!</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together your maggot-infested flour and moldy bread crumbs. This will form the perfect crust for your zombie apple pie.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to add some tangy flavor to your pie filling. Pour in a healthy dose of spoiled milk, and mix until it's nice and lumpy.</li>
        <li>To really make your zombie apple pie stand out, add in some blood of the undead. This will give it a lovely red color that's perfect for Halloween parties.</li>
        <li>For that earthy undertone, sprinkle in a little dirt. Don't worry, it's perfectly safe to eat as long as you don't mind a little grit in your teeth.</li>
        <li>For an extra kick, add in some rusty nails. Not only do they add a touch of metal to the mix, but they're a great source of iron too!</li>
        <li>Now it's time for the pièce de résistance: zombie brain matter. Because why not? Just be sure to chop it up into small pieces so it's evenly distributed throughout the pie.</li>
        <li>Finally, sprinkle in some decaying cinnamon and a squeeze of acidic lemon juice. This will really bring out the sour notes and give your pie that extra zesty kick.</li>
        <li>Once your pie filling is complete, pour it into your prepared crust and pop it in the oven for 45 minutes. And voila! You now have a deliciously gruesome zombie apple pie to share with all your friends and family.</li>
      </ol>
